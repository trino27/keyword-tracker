## Build Index Maps for Repeated Lookups

Multiple `.find()` calls by the same key should use a Map.

**Incorrect (O(n) per lookup):**

```typescript
function processOrders(orders: Order[], users: User[]) {
  return orders.map(order => ({
    ...order,
    user: users.find(u => u.id === order.userId)
  }))
}
```

**Correct (O(1) per lookup):**

```typescript
function processOrders(orders: Order[], users: User[]) {
  const userById = new Map(users.map(u => [u.id, u]))

  return orders.map(order => ({
    ...order,
    user: userById.get(order.userId)
  }))
}
```

Build map once (O(n)), then all lookups are O(1).
For 1000 orders × 1000 users: 1M ops → 2K ops.

## Proving it

The nesting is invisible in review: `orders.map(o => users.find(...))` reads as one operation.
Lock it down with a cost test that counts property reads on an instrumented input rather than
milliseconds. For example, joining 1500 rank snapshots to their pages with `find` costs over a
million reads; with a Map built once it costs a few thousand.
